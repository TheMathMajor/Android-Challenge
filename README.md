# Android Coding Challenge

### Description
The Android Challenge was to create an application that displays information received over the network.

### Technical Details
The requirement was to use a RecyclerView to display the data, so that was a big part of the application.  In order to display images from a URL, I used the Picasso library because it was the most convenient way to accomplish the task.
